sensor[nmbr] || sensorVal || variation from sensorVal(%) || timeStamps || amplitude || anode-cathode || stimulationActive || ...
... || parameters: freq, phase dur, etc. 


3. Peak detector of the signal (min-max-avg)?
4. Impedance? Voltage? 
5. Parameters controllable
6. Electrodes 1-2 problem
7. Problem with the signal sensor (NULL values?)


Maybe? 
1. Battery indicator?
